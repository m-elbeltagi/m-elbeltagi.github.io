## Professional Experience

**Research Assistant/Data Analyst @ Carleton University - Physics Department (_May 2018 - Present_)**
- Spearheaded the collection, storage and analysis of laboratory sensor data using **Python** and LabVIEW, enhancing the operational efficiency of particle physics experiment through uninterrupted monitoring and maintenance of a complex detector system.
- Developed a **Python** package for signal processing and time-series analysis (with **visualization** and **reports**), enabling pattern recognition and predictive maintenance that significantly reduced the risk of dielectric breakdowns in HV equipment.
- Applied innovative Monte Carlo methods in **machine learning** to improve probability density estimation for detector events, which sharpened the precision of measurement uncertainty. 


**NLP Engineer Intern @ Advanced Symbolics (Summer 2023)**
- Reasearched latest papers to engineer and integrate custom metrics to meticulously evaluate **NLP** tasks, including clustering and summarization, ensuring high-quality model output.
- Actively engaged in **MLOps** practices, orchestrating the seamless operation of **NLP** production pipelines on **AirFlow** (using **Git**), significantly minimizing downtime and bolstering continuous delivery of **machine learning** solutions.

**Physics Course Instructor @ Carleton University - Math Department (_Sep 2021 - Present_)**
- Led full-year physics courses on mechanics and electrostatics for high school students, developing and delivering lecture materials, coordinating with TAs for optimal student support.
